The Foundry Grill is a causal three meal a day restaurant with hearty, down-home seasonal flavor centered around the wood-burning grill, oven, and rotisserie. The Sundance Owl Bar features the original 1890's Rosewood bar that was frequented by Butch Cassidy's Hole-in-the-Wall gang, which was moved to Sundance from Thermopolis, Wyoming.</h3></td>
