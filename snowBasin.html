    <h2>Bio</h2>
    Snowbasin Utah is one of the oldest ski resorts in the United States, yet there are no remnants left of a bygone era. Much of the lift infrastructure is quite modern and the Snowbasin Ski Resort has extravagant day lodges, which look similar to those at sister resort Sun Valley. Despite the fancy trimmings for day trippers, Snowbasin is not a destination resort and there is no village or lodging at the ski area. The Snowbasin Ski Resort is not a household name like other Utah ski resorts such as Park City or Snowbird so it doesn’t attract quite the same crowds, although it’s still pretty busy.
