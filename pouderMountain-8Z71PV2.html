  <td><h3> With over 8,000 acres of skiable terrain, Powder Mountain is one of North America's largest ski areas. This is the place if you want endless pow or untouched corduroy. </h3></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><h3> Even on the busiest day, you may only find one skier per two acres of terrain. Almost 3,000 acres is a traditional lift served resort with an abundance of groomed trails and powder runs. The remaining 5,000 acres is nirvana for powder hounds. </h3></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><h3> Newcomers sometimes missed the best runs for their level of skiing and shredding so a team of locals was recruited to share their knowledge. Guests may choose from a free orientation over groomed cruisers with a Mountain Host or a day with a Mountain Adventure Pro making fresh tracks through secret glades, chutes & open bowls. After a few runs with a Pro or Host, guests naturally feel part of the Powder Mountain family. </h3></td>
</tr>
  <tr>
    <td><h3> For those seeking a once in a lifetime adventure, Powder Mountain offers guided backcountry tours at amazingly affordable prices. This season an additional 1,000 acres of expert chutes and bowls has been added to the current 2,000+ acres of intermediate terrain used by the Snowcat Powder Expedition. The all-day snowcat adventure is limited to 20 guests a day in order to preserve the quality of the experience. Wolf Canyon, Powder Mountain's steepest & deepest backcountry, is now open to a limited number of guided tours as well. </h3></td>
